/**
 * The queen's chamber is where the mating ritual between the queen and her
 * drones is conducted.  The drones will enter the chamber in order.
 * If the queen is ready and a drone is in here, the first drone will
 * be summoned and mate with the queen.  Otherwise the drone has to wait.
 * After a drone mates they perish, which is why there is no routine
 * for exiting (like with the worker bees and the flower field).
